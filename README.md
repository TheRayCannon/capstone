The purpose of this app is to be able to search for a particular beer, type of brew, or amenity that the local breweries might offer. It sets itself apart from many competitors with its specific search feature.

Can't remember where that "obi-wan" themed beer was from? No worries, go ahead and type what it is you are looking for into the search field.

The app will then display those results in a list where they can be perused and clicked to show more information about the brewery you selected.
